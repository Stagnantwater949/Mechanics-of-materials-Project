# Mechanics-of-materials-Project
Mandatory project for 2nd year mechanics of materials course teaching at IIITDM Kancheepuram
The actual Instructions were as follows,
"
The course project is to precisely analyze the solid mechanical elements (based on Mechanics of Materials principles discussed in classes) of a real (original) component (structural member) that helps in design / redesign / optimal design of structures. You should (must) take any practical (existing/real) mechanical component/member (either from a static structure or from a dynamic structure with proper approximation) as mentioned in regular practice classes.

You should take relevant data from manufacturer's website (material properties and loading conditions). You should clearly mention how you created a free body diagram of the component and did design/analysis.

Few examples:
(i) bicycle or bike frame member(s)
(ii) automobile / locomotive member(s)
(iii) automobile / pump / motor shaft(s)
(iv) aircraft / marine structural member(s)
(v) machine tool structural member(s)
(vi) Pressure vessels

Evaluation is completely based on your effort to understand the concepts like free body diagram, equations of equilibrium, formulations for axially loaded members, torsion of circular rods, bending of transversely loaded members, columns, complex state of stress and theories of failure.

If you just take elementary component with simple boundary conditions you will get marginal marks. On the other hand, if you take a complicated component with difficult boundary conditions you will get more marks. If you take a complex structure and try to analyze (find deflection/deformation and stresses) or design its members , you will get highest marks

Marks Distribution:
1. Free body diagram (with simplification for analysis) - 20%
2. Equations of equilibrium (including boundary conditions) - 20%
3. Analysis / design procedure and results - 40%
4. Presentation - 20%

You should send a PPT with (10+/-1) slides with the following details.

slide 1. Original component (including assembly details - photos/images)
slide 2. Free body diagram of component(s) (clearly spell out how you simplified - assumptions) and dimensions of the actual product
slide 3. Application of equations of equilibrium or governing equations (Mention characteristics/behavior of members used and boundary conditions)
slide 4. Analysis / Design procedure
slides 5-9. Results and Discussion
slide 10. Conclusion
